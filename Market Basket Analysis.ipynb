    "# Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "**Affinity Analysis** discovers co-occurrence relationships among activities performed by specific individuals or groups. In retail, affinity analysis is often used for market basket analysis. **Market Basket Analysis** is a technique used to uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of items that occur together frequently in transactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $I = {i_1, i_2, ..., i_n}$ be a set of n binary attributes called *items*.\n",
    "Let $T = {t_1, t_2, ..., t_m}$ be a database of *transactions*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each transaction *t* is a binary vector with $t[k] = 1$ if *t* contains the item $i_k$ and 0 otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "An **Association Rule** suggests a relationship between the items, and it's generally written like so: $ \\{Milk\\} \\Rightarrow \\{Bread\\} $. Note that X and Y in the equation below can contain multiple items and of course $X, Y \\subseteq I$. X is called the antecedent or left hand side (LHS), and Y is called the consequent, or right hand side (RHS).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ X \\Rightarrow Y $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support** is the relative frequency that the relationship occurs. The support of X with respect to T is the proportion of transactions *t* in the dataset which contains the item set X. You may want to look for high support in order to make sure it is a useful relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ supp(X) = \\frac{|\\{t\\in T; X \\subseteq t\\}|}{|T|} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ supp(X \\cup Y) = \\frac{|\\{t\\in T; X \\cup Y \\subseteq t\\}|}{|T|} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ supp \\in [0, 1] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$supp(X)$ is also known as the antecedent support, whereas $supp(Y)$ is the consequent support. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence** is the measure of reliability of the rule. A confidence of 0.50 would mean that in 50% of the cases where milk was purchased, so was bread. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ conf(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{frq(X \\cup Y)}{frq(X)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ conf(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{supp(X \\cup Y)}{supp(X)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ conf \\in [0, 1] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, confidence can be misleading, especially when the $supp(Y) > conf(X \\Rightarrow Y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lift** is given as the ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent. It measures how many times more often X and Y occur together than expected if they were statistically independent. A lift less than 1 means X and Y are negatively correlated. A lift value of 1 means the rules are completely independent. Lift values > 1 are generally more \"interesting\" and could be indicative of a useful rule pattern. With a high lift, the chance that the rule is just a coincidence is lower. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ lift(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{supp(X \\cup Y)}{supp(X) \\times supp(Y)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ lift \\in [0, \\infty] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Leverage** computes the difference between the observed frequency of X and Y occuring together and the frequency we would expect if X and Y were independent. A leverage value of 0 indicates independence\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ leverage(X \\Rightarrow Y) = supp(X \\Rightarrow Y) - (supp(X) \\times supp(Y)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ leverage \\in [-1, 1] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conviction** is the ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions. A conviction of 1.2 would mean that the rule would be incorrect 20% more often if the association between X and Y was purely random chance. A high conviction means that the consequent is highly dependent on the antecedent. Rules that always hold have a value of infinity. If the items are independent, the conviction is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ conv(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{1-supp(Y)}{1-conf(X \\Rightarrow Y)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ conv \\in [0, \\infty] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule Power Factor (RPF)** is an indication of how intense a rule's items are associated with each other in terms of positive relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ rpf(X \\Rightarrow Y) = \\frac{supp^2(X \\cup Y)}{supp(X)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other interestingness measures, such as all-confidence and collective strength\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Association rules generally need to satisify some specified minimum support and confidence (or other interestingness) threshold. The best rules generally have **high support** (the rule applies to a large amount of cases), **confidence** (the rule is reliable), and **lift** (the rule is not a coincidence)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A minimum support threshold is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database. This step is important as support-pruning also tends to eliminate most spurious correlations\n",
    "2. Minimum interesting-ness constraints are applied to these frequent itemsets in order to form rules\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the first step, finding all frequent itemsets in a database is difficult since it involves searching all item combinations. The set of possible item sets is the power set over I and has size $ 2^n - 1$. Efficient search is possible using the downward-closure property of support, which guarantees that for a frequent itemset, all its subsets are also frequent and thus no infrequent itemset can be a subset of a frequent itemset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Apriori** algorithm is used to find the frequent itemsets. It first identifies the frequent individual items in the database and then extends them into larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the algorithm that's used in the Python library `mlxtend`. There are a number of other algorithms that can be reviewed in the [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning) if you wish to do a custom implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences between Affinity Analysis & Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Both affinity analysis and collaborative filtering can be used to recommend items to users. In general, they seek to answer different questions. With collaborative filtering, it answers \"What items do users with similar interests to yours like?\" Market basket analysis aims to answer \"What items are frequently associated with each other?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In market basket analysis, we consider each basket for a user separately, whereas collaborative filtering considers baskets aggregated per user. \n",
    "\n",
    "In market basket analysis, you also consider different measurements, such as support and lift, and there is directionality in the relationships. For example, $X \\Rightarrow Y$ is not the same as $Y \\Rightarrow X$. Collaborative filtering uses symmetric measures, like cosine similarity. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible for collaborative filtering to come up with more indirect similarities. Such as, if you buy item 1, it could find that item 2 is bought along with it, and also item 3 and 4 are similar to 2. Then it can recommend items 3 and 4, even if they're not often associated with item 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Affinity analysis is also generally used as an exploratory tool.\n",
