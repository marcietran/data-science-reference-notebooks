# About this Repo

I often create general Python notebooks for exploring certain data science topics broadly and have found them helpful for later jogging my memory or being a source of re-usable functions that I can plug in to more specific projects. In some of these notebooks, I also lay out the basic statistical theory behind the methodologies explored, in addition to how to apply them with Python. 

In these notebooks,  the data sets aren't particulary interesting and often too small to do any significant analysis, as the goal is not to analyze a specific data set, but to lay a framework for approaching a type of problem. In this case, the data sets are just placeholders, so I try to keep them lean but enough to illustrate the concepts.
